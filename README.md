### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently brushing up my skills for research positions, and SDE roles.
Main Self learning: CS61A/CS61B, Leetcode and incorporating generative AI.
This year I also intend to give importance to personal growth. Some other personal goals:
- NASM-CPT certification
- PADI Open water Diver

âš¡ Fun fact: Lived in Spain. Back to HK with my 3 lovely cats. A little nerd at heart, while being spontaneous sometimes. Curiosity and passion are always the combo to enjoy life. You can find me watching anime at home, working out at the gym, hiking, or simply cuddling with my cats. Many adventures and plans ahead!
